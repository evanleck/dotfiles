# ~/.dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. [There](ap) [are](gb) [many](jf) [like](xero) them, but
these are mine.

Global packages are managed by [Homebrew](brew) and project-local packages are
managed by [mise-en-place](mise) which is itself managed by Homebrew.

Placement is powered by [stow](stow) and inspired in great part by "[Managing
dotfiles with GNU stow](managing)."
