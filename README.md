# ~/.dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. [There](ap) [are](gb) [many](jf) [like](xero) them, but
these are mine.

Global and project-local packages are managed by [Devbox](devbox). This replaces
tools I've used previously including [Homebrew](brew), [asdf](asdf), and
[Fisher](fisher). Configuration files for some of those tools have been retained
until I can migrate all my systems to use Devbox.

Placement is powered by [stow](stow) and inspired in great part by "[Managing
dotfiles with GNU stow](managing)."
